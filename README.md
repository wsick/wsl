# WSL 
(Wicked Sick Language pronounced like wassail)

Domain-specific language intended to represent user interfaces.

## Objectives
The purpose of this language is to take the great parts of XML, JSON, and HCL with user interfaces in mind.  The language should be dense, terse, and easy to parse.  This will allow for faster transmission, easier reading on the screen, and improved parse performance.
